# Web Scraping With Selenium WebDriver
## Introduction
The following program takes the url of a specific consumer website that leads to the customer reviews section for a particular product and starts the automatic process of scraping reviews. I (Author) do not own any of the gathered data, hence I will not upload any of the sets of gathered data. To further prevent sharing of data, I have also removed some lines of code to prevent others from directly executing the program to gather data. This project is purely for educational purposes and self-entertainment. I highly encourage other parties interested in data scraping to write their own program that adheres with the targeted website's TOS (especially robots.txt) and other ethical scraping practices.

## Requirements
For best compatibility the following versions are recommended
- Python v3.x
- Selenium v4.3.x
- Chrome and ChromeDriver v101.0.4951.41
- Numpy v1.19.5
- Pandas v1.2.4

## Usage
Only use source code for reference and educational purposes. Inside this project there are two scrapers with the .py extension. The result of the scrapers is written to a txt file with uncleaned data. To further clean the gathered data, a viable option is to use numpy and pandas. An example of data cleaning can be found in the jupyter notebook (cleaner.ipynb).

## Contributing
Do not push any changes to the repo. Instead, create an issue in github to suggest changes/addition.
